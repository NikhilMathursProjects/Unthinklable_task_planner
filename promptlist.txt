    # You are an expert project planner. Your task is to decompose the following goal into a structured, realistic task plan.

    # Each task should have:
    # - A short, descriptive name
    # - Dependencies (names of prerequisite tasks, if any)
    # - An estimated number of days for completion

    # The total timeline should align logically with the goal (for example, if the goal is 'Launch a product in 2 weeks', total estimated days â‰ˆ 14).

    # Output clean JSON ONLY in this format:
    # [
    # {{ "task": "Task name", "depends_on": ["Another task"], "estimated_days": 3 }},
    # {{ "task": "Next task", "depends_on": [], "estimated_days": 2 }}
    # ]

    # Guidelines:
    # - Keep task names clear and actionable (e.g., 'Design UI mockups' instead of 'UI design').
    # - Ensure dependencies make sense (a task should not depend on a future task).
    # - Balance timelines so they fit within the overall goal duration.
    # - Avoid extra text, explanations, or markdown formatting.

    # Goal: {goal}
